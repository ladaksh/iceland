   ```text
   Iceland is known for it's geothermal baths and wellness centers located all over the country. Vök is known for its floating hot pools in the Urriðavatn lake but it uniqueness is the source of the water. The East of Iceland does not have the abundance of geothermal energy as most parts of the country. The water you bathe in Vök baths comes from a mile deep (1600 meters) under the lake and is certified as the purest hot water in Iceland. Close to 70°C straight from the ground you can enjoy it in the warm pools as well as in your cup of tea with fresh Icelandic herbs from the tea bar.
